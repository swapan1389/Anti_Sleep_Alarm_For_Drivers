# Anti_Sleep_Alarm_For_Drivers
Project Title: Anti Sleep Alarm For Drivers

Project Description:

This project is an anti-sleep alarm for drivers designed to help prevent drowsy driving. Drowsy driving is a major cause of road accidents, and this project aims to reduce the number of accidents caused by driver fatigue.

The anti-sleep alarm uses a variety of sensors to detect signs of drowsiness, including the driver's head tilt angle, eye closure, and eyelid movement. If the alarm detects any of these signs, it will sound an alarm to wake the driver up.


Project Features:

Detects signs of drowsiness using a variety of sensors
Sounds an alarm to wake the driver up
Easy to use and install
Does not require any special modifications to the vehicle
Project Benefits:

Reduces the risk of drowsy driving accidents
Improves driver safety
Helps to prevent injuries and fatalities
Project Requirements:

Relay:
Piezo buzzer:
Wires:
9v battery:
Gear motor:
Wheel:
Arduino nano
SPST switch:
Eye blink sensor:

Project Implementation:

The anti-sleep alarm is implemented using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The Eye blink sensor sensor is used to measure the driver's head tilt angle, eye closure, and eyelid movement. The servo motor is used to turn the buzzer on and off. The buzzer is used to sound the alarm.

The code for the anti-sleep alarm is written in the Arduino programming language. The code uses the Eye blink sensor library to read the data from the sensor. The code then checks the data to see if any of the signs of drowsiness are present. If any of the signs are present, the code sounds the alarm.

Project Testing:

The anti-sleep alarm was tested using a variety of methods. The alarm was tested with different drivers to see how well it detected signs of drowsiness. The alarm was also tested in different driving conditions, such as on the highway and on city streets.

The results of the testing showed that the anti-sleep alarm was able to detect signs of drowsiness with a high degree of accuracy. The alarm was also able to sound the alarm in a timely manner, preventing the driver from falling asleep.

Project Conclusion:

The anti-sleep alarm is a valuable tool that can help to prevent drowsy driving accidents. The alarm is also effective in detecting signs of drowsiness and sounding the alarm in a timely manner.
